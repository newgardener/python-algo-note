Time Complexity: O(26*N)
=> (size of window - most frequent character) <= k
each time we need to scan through the hash map to find the most frequent character
this leads to time complexity O(26*N)

Further
how to optimize the time complexity to O(N)?
=> store mostFrequent in a constant time
=> the purpose of this problem is to maximize the size of window which means we do not need to update mostFrequent when window size shrinks
